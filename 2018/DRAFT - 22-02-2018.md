## Introduction

Dear devonfw community,

We present the sixth edition of the ‘we-dev-on’ newsletter, the reader-supported publication for and from the devonfw & OASP communities all over Capgemini APPS2. This edition covers TODO XXX.

## E2E test framework

In case of E2E (End to end) tests, this are either tests through technology stack or functional stack. 
Depends on what is your goal. 

Everything with tangible examples of how to build resilient and robust integration test cases. Wrapped with experience taken from variety of IT projects. 

This is how we see and use E2E test framework. 
Allows to execute in one test file:  
1. Alter value on database 
2. Then validate on webservice this change 
   and finally 
3. On UI verify update 
OR
1.	On UI trigger an action 
2.	Then on UI validate response of this action 

To summarize, below is a list of modules, as a ingredients of E2E test framework.
