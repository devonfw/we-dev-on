## Introduction

Dear devonfw community,

We present the third edition of the 'we-dev-on' newsletter, the reader-supported publication for and from the devonfw & OASP communities all over Capgemini APPS2. This edition covers the new releases of devonfw and OASP as well as some updates and announcements.


This edition covers the new releases of devonfw and OASP as well as some updates and announcements.
The iCSD Core Team

## Microservices Webcast 

Friday the 16th of June there will be a webcast about the new devonfw Microservices module. The webcast will show the architecture and the details of how to use the module, based on Spring Cloud and the Netflix OSS stack. We hope to be able to demonstrate a real, working example during webcast. We will announce the definitive hour and agenda later in the month.  Keep an eye out for that announcement in the _Devon_ group in Yammer.

## Devonfw Harvest Status update

The Spanish team from the engagement in Valencia which has agreed to participate in the devonfw Harvest has been busy and a number of modules have been extracted already. They are now in the process of being finalized. Once done we will do a short status webcast. 

## OASP4J 2.3.0 and devonfw 2.1.2 release

We've released the latest update release of devonfw in the _Balu_ series: version 2.1.2. The next major release, code named _Courage_, will be released approximately the end of June. This current release contains the following items:

### OASP4j 2.3.0 Release

Friday the 12th of May 2017 OASP4J version 2.3.0 was released. Major features added are : 

- Database Integration with PostGres, MSSQL Server, MariaDB
- Added docs folder for gh pages and added oomph setups
- Refactored Code
- Refactored Test Infrastructure
- Added Documentation on debugging tests
- Added Two Batch Job tests in the restaurant sample
- Bugfix: Fixed the error received when the Spring Boot Application from sample application that is created from maven archetype is launched
- Bugfix: Fix for 404 error received when clicked on the link '1. Table' in index.html of the sample application created from maven archetype

More details on features added can be found at https://github.com/oasp/oasp4j/milestone/23?closed=1 . 
The OASP4j wiki and other documents are updated for release 2.3.0. 

### Cobigen Enhancements

Previous versions of CobiGen are able to generate code for REST services only. Now it is possible to generate the code for SOAP services as well. There are two use cases available in CobiGen:

 - SOAP without nested data
 - SOAP nested data

The "nested data" use case is when there are 3 or more entities which are interrelated with each other. Cobigen will generate code which will return the nested data. Currently Cobigen services return ETO classes, Cobigen has been enhanced as to return CTO classes (ETO + relationship). 


Apart from the SOAP code generation, the capability to express nested relationships have been added to the existing ReST code generator as well.

See: https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-cobigen-advanced-use-cases-soap-and-nested-data

### Micro services module (Spring Cloud/Netflix OSS)

To make it easier for devonfw users to design and develop applications based on microservices, this release provides a series of archetypes and resources based on _Spring Cloud Netflix_ to automate the creation and configuration of microservices.

New documentation ind de devonfw Guide contais all the details to start [creating microservices with Devonfw](https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/devon-microservices)

### Spring Integration Module

Based on the _Java Message Service_ (JMS) and _Spring Integration_, the devonfw _Integration module_ provides a communication system (sender/subscriber) out-of-the-box with simple channels (only to send and read messages), request and reply channels (to send messages and responses) and request & reply asynchronously channels. You can find more details about the implementation in the [Devonfw guide](https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-integration-module). 

### WebSphere & Wildfly deployment documentation

The new version of devonfw contains more elaborate and updated documentation about deployment on [WebSpere](https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-Deployment-on-WebSphere) and [Wildfly](https://github.com/devonfw/devon/wiki/cookbook-Deployment-on-Wildfly).

## Cooperation of CSD Italy & iCSD devonfw Core Team

### One Team approach of iCSD devonfw Core Team and CSD Italy created a real win-win situation

A strong collaborative approach and an intensive mutual exchange of support between the iCSD devonfw core team and Italian CSD teams lead to a valuable enhancement of devonfw -the iCSD development framework- based on the needs of a concrete sales PoC and a real customer project.

The cooperation between the iCSD Core Team and two Italian teams targeted to use the expertise of the devonfw core team members for the creation of concrete project deliverables and services to be proposed in sales process, which should base on devonfw as framework.

The collaboration created a classical win-win result. On the one hand it leads to an efficient asset creation and on the other hand it assured the feasibility of the created assets as enhancement of the devonfw framework itself.

### Benefit 1: Devonfw SOAP – a PoC for Intesa San Paolo project   

In the Banking sector the usage of the SOAP protocol for web services is widespread. The PoC targeted on the enhancement of Cobigen - the devonfw code generator. With new implemented templates the generation of java classes for SOAP services should be enabled. The PoC started in January 2017 and was completed successfully within two months end of March. This new Cobigen feature will now enforce our delivery capability in the Banking sector. This feature will also be available for all other devonfw projects with the release of Devonfw version 2.2 “Courage”. This release is scheduled for June 2017.

### Benefit 2: Italian Mobile Project Support

Part of the scope of the Italian CSD project HERA is the delivery of an Ionic kickstarter application integrated in the IBM Mobile First 7.1 platform. The kickstarter accelerates the mock-up development of new mobile apps based on this platform and effects a faster delivery. The collaboration between the devonfw core team and the Hera project team started in November 2016 and delivered successfully in March 2017.

The devonfw core team staffed and supported the project with experts in Angular 2 and Ionic 2. These experts enhanced devonfw with features, supporting these technologies. Based on this support and the new features, the HERA project team then implemented the kickstarter application. The first App, created with this kickstarter application will go live in May 2017.

The enhanced Ionic and Angular features will be available also for all other devonfw projects with the next release of Devonfw. Both  achievements are the results of a real one-team-approach of all team members, based on mutual trust and a strong will for collaboration.

Thanks to all contributors of these achievements:

_iCSD devonfw core Team_: Iwan Rochus Van der Kleijn, Santos Jimenez Linares, Roberto Garcia Marin, Kevin Dierks

_Team Intesa San Paolo, Italy_: Lorenzo Bazzani, Stefano Rossini, Niraj Borkar, Mumbai Offshore Team
