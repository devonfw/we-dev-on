## Introduction

Dear devonfw community,

We present the ffith edition of the ‘we-dev-on’ newsletter, the reader-supported publication for and from the devonfw & OASP communities all over Capgemini APPS2. This edition covers the new release of devonfw, version 2.2 as well as the combined Design Authority meeting of the Production Line and devonfw.

## YOUR TOPIC HERE

### CobiGen 3.0.0

CobiGen has evolved over the last months a lot. Several new plug-ins now support merging of JSON, Angular Html snippets, and TypeScript. We even enabled the use of different template languages as some of you prefer to use Velocity rather than FreeMarker. There you go!

The new demand of maintaining more than 10 plug-ins finally caused a huge amount of time to transport a bugfix to the user. Therefore, enabled the support of the already existing modularity on Java level also for the eclipse world as well as the maven world. Bugfixes can now be immediately released and used by anyone no matter in which plug-in the bug is located.

*What you might not have seen so far?*

* [cobigen.properties](https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen/wiki/cobigen-core_configuration#template-properties): Specify static properties to be used within your properties and thus configure your generation on a project basis
* [Multi-module support](https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen/wiki/cobigen-core_configuration#multi-module-support-or-template-target-path-redirects): redirect the target path of your templates by setting the `relocate` property in any `cobigen.properties`
* [Change the template engine](https://github.com/devonfw/tools-cobigen/wiki/cobigen-core_configuration#templates-configuration): You can change the template engine per templates configuration (`templates.xml`). Currently, there are plug-ins for [FreeMarker](http://freemarker.org/) and [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/).
