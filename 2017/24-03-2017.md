## Preview Devonfw Microservices

![Devon Microservices](img/devon_microservices.png)

Microservices is a software architecture approach based on dividing the application in a group of small and independent services, each one of those is related to a business domain, run in its own process and communicate with each other with lightweight mechanisms like, often, HTTP resource API.

Having that separation of _functionalities_ in different services allows to introduce changes in one of those services without affecting the entire application. Thus fixing, updating or scaling one particular service can be done without the necessity of redeploying the whole application. We can find real examples of microservices architectures in popular and high demanded services like [Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/), [Amazon](http://highscalability.com/blog/2007/9/18/amazon-architecture.html) or [eBay](http://www.addsimplicity.com/downloads/eBaySDForum2006-11-29.pdf).

To make it easier for Devonfw users to design and develop applications based on microservices, next Devonfw release will provide a series of archetypes and resources to automate the creation of the needed components, pre-configured and ready to start working.

As microservices implementation, [Spring Cloud Netflix](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/) provides [Netflix OSS](https://netflix.github.io/) integrations for _Spring Boot_ apps through autoconfiguration and binding to the Spring Environment.

Based on _Spring Cloud Netflix_, next Devonfw release will offer microservices archetypes and a complete user guide with all the details to start creating microservices with Devonfw. You can find more details of _Spring Cloud Netflix_ components [here](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-netflix/1.3.0.M1/).

New Devonfw components:

- microservices infrastructure archetype: generates all the _Spring Cloud Netflix_ pre-configured projects to provide all the components of the microservices architecture.

** routing service, the entry point of the app (_Zuul_)

** service discovery, to register and locate the microservices (_Eureka_).

** auth service (based on [jwt](https://jwt.io/))

- microservice archetype: generates a microservice project pre-configured to be used with the _Spring Cloud Netflix_ infrastructure.

- user guide: The Devonfw guide will have a new section with all microservices details. You can see a preview [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon-guide/wiki/devon-microservices) and [here](https://github.com/devonfw/devon-guide/wiki/Client-GUI-Sencha-with-devonfw-microservices).

## Italian Mobile Project Support

Since last November, the Devonfw Core Team collaborates with the **Italy Hera Team** in order to build a common development environment based on **Ionic 2 and Angular 2** for mobile apps, which is compatible and integrated with **IBM Mobile First Platform 7.1**. 

This collaboration consists in two main points:
1. The definition and development of an Ionic 2 kickstarter application integrated in the mentioned platform.
2. The improvement of the Devonfw Cobigen generator to create Angular 2 & Ionic 2 applications. Currently, the Cobigen improvement is in progress and is almost done for Angular 2 applications. 

As an expert on Angular 2 and Ionic 2 I was the person in charge to get the first point done and to monitor the development of the second one. 

I had to study the IBM Mobile First platform and resolve the issues related to compatibility between versions and technologies, as this platform and Ionic are evolving very fast. After some research and hard work I got this kickstarter app work fine in the IBM platform, so I could show the results in one of the week skype meetings that we hold the two teams. Afterwards, I could help in the starting phase of the development of the first PoC that our italian colleagues wanted to develop to master Ionic 2 development.

After a few weeks the italian team showed us the first Ionic 2 application over the IBM Mobile First platform with a lot of powerful features. It was a great job!

Our collaboration will continue in the next months, as the Italian Team will embrace the new IBM Mobile First platform version next summer, which is closer to the current frontend and mobile development, and the Devonfw Core Team will finish the development of the Angular 2 and Ionic 2 Cobigen support.
